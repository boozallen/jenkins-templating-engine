= Jenkins Templating Engine 2.0 

Version 2.0 will cover a few high-level epics: 

* Integration with https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-plugin[Pipeline: Groovy Plugin]
* Code Cleanliness
* Feature Development 

== Project Board

Items for the 2.0 release are tracked via https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/issues[Issues on the repository] and the 2.0 scope can be seen via the https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/projects/2[GitHub Project].

== Integration with Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

=== JTE Initialization (https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/issues/87[#87])

==== Pre-2.0 Initialization Process
Until now, JTE's initialization has taken place **after** the pipeline has actually started.  From a code standpoint, that means it was happening within the pipeline as opposed to happening within "plugin" code. This introduced technical complexities associated with the fact that the plugin was limited in the same way that Jenkins pipelines are in regard to CPS. 

This was accomplished by creating a https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/blob/1.7.1/src/main/groovy/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/TemplateEntryPointVariable.groovy[TemplateEntryPoint Global Variable] that provided a ``template`` step to Jenkins. This step would then go and compile the https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/blob/1.7.1/src/main/resources/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/TemplateEntryPoint.groovy[Entry Point Script] in the resources directory.  Every time a user selected "Jenkins Templating Engine" as the pipeline definition, we hard code that the pipeline simply invoked this template step via ``template()`` as seen https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/blob/1.7.1/src/main/groovy/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/job/TemplateFlowDefinition.groovy#L70[Here]. 

This is visible to end users.  When you try to "replay" a Jenkins pipeline that uses JTE what you'll see as the main script is just ``template()``. 

==== 2.0 Updates

The first step to achieving a lot of the feature enhancements users were asking for relies on improving this initialization process. 

JTE 2.0 completely rethinks how to initialize the pipeline.  We have been able to completely remove the ``TemplateEntryPointVariable`` Global Variable. 

Now, all JTE pipelines extend off of a https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/blob/2.0/src/main/groovy/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/job/TemplateFlowDefinition.groovy#L52-L58[``TemplateFlowDefinition``] that makes use of an invisible build action called https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/blob/2.0/src/main/groovy/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/init/PipelineDecorator.groovy[``PipelineDecorator``] that handles the initialization process for JTE and stores the additions to be injected into the pipeline's runtime environment via a https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/blob/2.0/src/main/groovy/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/init/GroovyShellDecoratorImpl.groovy[``GroovyShellDecoratorImpl``]. 

This GroovyShellDecoratorImpl is then responsible for taking the primitives that were created and injecting them into the template's environment prior to execution.  This class also plugs into the compilation process of the template to wrap it in a ``try-finally`` such that JTE's lifecycle hooks can be executed prior to template execution and post template execution.

=== Pipeline Resumability

Some users rely on the resumability of Jenkins Pipelines promised by Jenkins.  Because of how JTE currently works, there is a bug preventing Jenkins from resuming a pipeline managed by JTE.

== Code Cleanliness 

As JTE grows in adoption, there is plenty that can be done to improve our ability to collaborate on the code base.  The following tickets are internal-facing changes that will help remediate technical debt, standardize coding styles, and better communicate the software architecture.

* [x] https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/issues/85[Refactor JTE's package structure more logically]
* [x] https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/issues/82[Use a Factory pattern for creating StepWrappers]
* [x] https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/issues/86[Integrate CodeNarc for common styling]
* [x] https://github.com/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin/issues/81[Add JavaDocs throughout the codebase to better communicate the purpose of different classes]
