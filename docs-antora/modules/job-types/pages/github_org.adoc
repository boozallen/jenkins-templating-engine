= GitHub Organization Job

JTE can be used to apply a pipeline template to an entire GitHub Organization by creating a *GitHub Organization* job in Jenkins.

To configure this, under the *Projects* section you will set the *Project Recognizer* as `Jenkins Templating Engine` (as shown below)

== Repository Configuration

Note, the *GitHub Organization* project can configure a *Governance Tier* for specifying pipeline templates, library sources, and applying a pipeline configuration to every branch of every repository in a GitHub Organization.

You can find these settings under the `Jenkins Templating Engine` section of the job configuration, as shown below:
