= Jenkins Templating Engine

The Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE) is a plugin developed by Booz Allen Hamilton enabling
pipeline templating and governance. JTE  allows you to consolidate 
pipelines into shareable workflows that define the business logic of 
your software delivery processes while allowing for optimal pipeline code reuse by
pulling out tool specific implementations into library modules.
