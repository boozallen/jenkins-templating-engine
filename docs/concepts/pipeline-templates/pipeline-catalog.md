# Pipeline Catalog

It's unlikely, especially when first starting out, that all your organization's pipelines will map to a single [Pipeline Template](../pipeline-templates/index.md).

JTE supports having multiple Pipeline Templates that teams can choose from.

These templates are organized into Pipeline Catalogs configured on [Governance Tiers](../pipeline-governance/governance-tier.md).

## Default Pipeline Template

Pipeline Catalogs can have a **default Pipeline Template**.

## Named Pipeline Templates

Additional Pipeline Templates are called **Named Pipeline Templates**.

    For more information, you can learn where templates are organized and how to create multiple templates over on the [Governance Tier Reference Page](../../reference/governance-tier.md) page.
    You can learn more about how JTE chooses the Pipeline Template for a run over at [Pipeline Template Selection](../pipeline-governance/pipeline-template-selection.md).
