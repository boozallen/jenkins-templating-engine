SCM Library Provider
--------------------

The SCM Library Provider allows you to configure a source code repository containing your libraries.

To configure, you'll need to provide the scm specific (git, etc) properties such as repository URL and
credential to access the remote repository.  You can also provide the base directory within which the
library directories can be found.
