=  What is a pipeline template?

When developing a pipeline used by multiple teams, you'll often find that the workflow is the same while the specifics of what each step in the process does may differ between applications.

Whether the application is a Java app packaged as a war and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance or a React app being statically bundled and deployed to an S3 bucket or Nginx instance, the steps in your pipeline are the same.

In this example, both applications could have a pipeline workflow that performs unit testing, static code analysis, packaging an artifact, and deploying that artifact to an application environment.

You would represent this workflow in a template! Templates are built by calling steps and referencing primitives defined in your pipeline configuration file.

==  Steps

Pipeline steps are methods supplied by pipeline libraries that implement a specific action in your pipeline template. In your pipeline configuration file you will specify what libraries should be loaded.

Each of these libraries will contribute steps that can be called from your pipeline template.

In our simple example, a pipeline template could be defined as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
unit_test()
static_code_analysis()
build()
deploy_to dev
----

This template could be reused by multiple teams using different tools by xref:library-development:getting_started.adoc[creating libraries] which implement the pipeline steps `unit_test`, `static_code_analysis`, `build`, and `deploy_to`.  Once these libraries are created, a configuration file is created to specify which libraries to load.

For the deployment step, you'll notice that a `dev` application environment was referenced to specify where the deployment should take place. This `dev` application environment is an example of a primitive that can be defined alongside your template in the configuration file.

==  Primitives

Primitives are template constructs whose purpose is to make the pipeline template as simple and easy to read as possible.

The default primitives currently supported are xref:primitives:application_environments.adoc[Application Environments], xref:primitives:keywords.adoc[Keywords], and xref:primitives:stages.adoc[Stages]. 

It is possible to write a Jenkins Plugin that extends the Jenkins Templating Engine to add a custom primitve. Please reach out in the https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/templating-engine-plugin[Gitter Channel] to discuss if this seems like something you should do. 

==  Configuration Files

To complete this example, we can build out sample pipeline configuration files for each application.

Configuration files provide the information necessary to populate a pipeline template with what's needed to execute.

For our example, we can define a common pipeline configuration to be inherited by both applications that defines the development application environment and a common SonarQube pipeline library to perform the static code analysis:

[source,groovy]
----
// define common application environment
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development"
        ec2{
            ips = [ "1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5" ]
            credential_id = "ec2_ssh"
        }
        s3{
            url = "https://s3.example.com"
            path = "content/"
            credential_id = "s3_bucket"
        }
    }
}

// define pipeline libraries common between applications
libraries{
    merge = true
    sonarqube // supplies the static_code_analysis step
}
----

For the Java application:

[source, groovy]
----
libraries{
    java  // supplies the build step
    junit // supplies the unit_test step
    ec2   // supplies the deploy_to step
}
----

For the React application:

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
    React // supplies the build step
    jest  // supplies the unit_test step
    s3    // supplies the deploy_to step
}
----

You would then create a xref:governance:governance_tier.adoc[Governance Tier] to point JTE to your common configuration and place the application specific configurations at the root of their source code repository in a file called `pipeline_config.groovy`.
