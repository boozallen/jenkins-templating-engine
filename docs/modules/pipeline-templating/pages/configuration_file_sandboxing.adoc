= Configuration File Sandboxing

Jenkins Templating Engine `pipeline_config.groovy` configuration files are a custom DSL intent on making configuration as user friendly as possible.

Due to the fact that these configuration files get executed as a script, their runtime is extremely sandboxed to allow little more than key/value setting.

Attempting to do inappropriate things, like accessing the `/etc/passwd` file on the master, will result in a Security Exception being thrown.

For example, the following configuration file:

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development"
    }
}

password = new File("/etc/passwd").text
----

would result in:
