=  Configuration Files

With the Jenkins Templating Engine, configuration files are used to populate templates with the information necessary to execute.

The configuration file is a groovy file named `pipeline_config.groovy` that gets placed at the root of the source code repository or within a pipeline configuration repository.

==  Syntax

The configuration file is a custom groovy domain specific language intended to avoid the burdensome syntax of JSON without the whitespace pitfalls of YAML.

While the flexibility of what can be done within a configuration file is limited by the xref:configuration_file_sandboxing.adoc[sandbox], the file is executed as a groovy script and builds a configuration object.

The configuration file acts as a nested builder language will accept any arbitrary configuration. Beyond several JTE configuration fields, it is up to specific primitives and libraries to provide meaning to the keys and values provided within a configuration.

== Specification

The following is an overview of the configuration file schema.

[source,groovy]
----
jte{ <1>
    allow_scm_jenkinsfile = true
    pipeline_template = "some_template"
    permissive_initialization = false
    reverse_library_resolution = false
}

template_methods{} <2>

libraries{ <3>
    someLibrary {} <4>
}

stages{} <5>
application_environments{} <6>
keywords{} <7>
----
<1> The `jte` block defines framework-level configurations
<2> `template_methods` define the list of steps that may be invoked from a template
<3> The `libraries` block declares the libraries to be loaded
<4> Nested blocks within `libraries` represent a library to be loaded and parameters to pass to the library via the autowired `config` variable
<5> xref:primitives:stages.adoc[Stages] keep templates DRY to grouping steps
<6> xref:primitives:application_environments.adoc[Application Environments] encapsulate environmental context
<7> xref:primitives:keywords.adoc[Keywords] define variables for use in templates

=== JTE Block

|===
| Field | Description | Default Value

| `allow_scm_jenkinsfile`
| whether or not to permit application-specific pipeline templates within source code repositories.
| `true`

| `pipeline_template`
| A named template to fetch from a Governance Tier, per the xref:governance:pipeline_template_selection.adoc[Pipeline Template Selection] process
| `null`

| `permissive_initialization`
| Whether or not JTE will allow a naming collision within the binding. For example, two library's that both contribute a step by the same name or a keyword and application environment by the same name.
| `false`

| `reverse_library_resolution`
| Normally, JTE resolves libraries based on the library sources from the highest governance tier down towards the job, xref:governance:library_selection.adoc[default library selection]. This flag, if enabled, reverses the library search order
| `false`

|===

[WARNING]
====
It is strongly recommended that `permissive_initialization` remain false. Before enabling, ask yourself if there is perhaps a better name for the steps and primitives that are being created instead of allowing JTE to load multiple primitives by the same name.

When `permissive_initialization` is enabled the original, using the shorthand invocation will throw an exception. JTE requires that if multiple steps or primitives have the same name that they be accessed via the xref:primitives:primitive_namespace.adoc[Primitive Namespace]. 
====

== Environment Substitutions

In Jenkins, environment variables are made accessible via the ``env`` global variable.  This variable is resolvable within your pipeline configuration file.

This also means that Build Parameters can be access within the pipeline configuration file as they are stored on the ``env`` variable.

For example, in the following configuration:

.pipeline_config.groovy
[source, groovy]
----
libraries{
    someLibrary{
        someField = env.buildParam ?: "default if not set"
    }
}
----

``libraries.someLibrary.someField`` would resolve to the Build Parameter named ``buildParam`` and would default to ``default if not set`` if ``buildParam`` was not truthy.
