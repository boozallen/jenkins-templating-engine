= Multibranch Job

JTE can be used to apply a pipeline template to an entire repository by creating a *Multibranch Project*.

To configure this, under the *Build Configuration* you will set the *mode* as `Jenkins Templating Engine`

== Exclude Branches Without `pipeline_config.groovy`

When `Jenkins Templating Engine` is selected, a checkbox option is presented to exclude branches in source code repositories that do not have a `pipeline_config.groovy` file at the root of the repository. 

The default value is to create pipeline jobs for every branch regardless of whether a `pipeline_config.groovy` is present or not. 

== Repository Configuration

Note, the *Multibranch Project* type can configure a *Governance Tier* for specifying pipeline templates, library sources, and applying a pipeline configuration to the entire repository.

You can find these settings under the `Jenkins Templating Engine` section of the job configuration.
