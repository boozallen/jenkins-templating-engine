= Governance Tier

Templates define the business logic of the pipeline and a configuration file is used to implement the functionality of the template.

If you would like to leverage the templating capabilities of JTE without sharing workflows between applications, you can place a `Jenkinsfile` template at the root of your application's source code repository alongside the `pipeline_config.groovy` configuration file.

If you would like to consolidate templates or common configurations, you can put organizational templates and common configurations into a *Governance Tier*.

Governance Tiers consist of xref:pipeline-templating:configuration_files.adoc[Configuration Files], xref:library-development:library_sources/library_sources.adoc[Library Sources], and xref:pipeline-templating:configuration_files.adoc[Pipeline Templates].
