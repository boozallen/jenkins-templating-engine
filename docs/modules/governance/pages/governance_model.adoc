= Governance Model

One of the challenges associated with having a Jenkinsfile in every application source code repository is having governance within an organization over how software
gets developed.

Each team may be doing something slightly differently and developers have access to bypass any required security gates by manipulating the Jenkinsfile.

With the Jenkins Templating Engine, you're able to have a much clearer picture of the software delivery processes within an organization by consolidating your pipeline
into a set of reusable templates managed within one or multiple pipeline configuration repositories.

With JTE, you can configure a governance structure matching your organization's hierarchy through Governance Tiers.
