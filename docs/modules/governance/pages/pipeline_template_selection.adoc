= Pipeline Template Selection

Pipeline Templates can either come from the application's source code repository, from the default template in a governance tier, or from a named template in a governance tier.

== 1. Application Source Code Repository

By default, if there is a Jenkinsfile within the application's source code repository it will be used as the pipeline template.

Governance Tier's can choose to disable this flexibility to enforce the use of consolidated templates by setting `allow_scm_jenkinsfile = false` in the `jte` block of their configuration file.

== 2. Named Pipeline Template

Within a Governance Tier, you can create a `pipeline_templates` directory alongside the `pipeline_config.groovy` configuration file. Within this directory you can have as many different templates as you'd like and they will be referenceable via their filename from the configuration file.

To select a named pipeline template, you can specify `pipeline_template = <template name>` in the `jte` block of your configuration file.

If a named pipeline template is specified, JTE will recursively search the `pipeline_templates` directories of each Governance Tier going up the hierarchy from most specific all the way to the Global Governance Tier defined in `Manage Jenkins > Configure System`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a named pipeline template is specified and the template is not found in any Governance Tier, JTE will throw a Template Not Found Exception and fail the build.
====

== 3. Default Pipeline Template

If there is not an application repository `Jenkinsfile` or one is not permitted, and a named pipeline template has not been specified, JTE will look for the first Governance Tier Default Pipeline Template in ascending order.

To create a Default Pipeline Template, simply create a `Jenkinsfile` alongside the `pipeline_config.groovy` configuration file in the Governance Tier.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If no Default Pipeline Template can be found, then no pipeline template has been defined and JTE will fail the build.
