= Application Environments

The Application Environment primitive exists to simplify referencing deployment targets from pipeline templates.

== Configuration File Specification

The `application_environments` key is used to begin declaring application environments.

Within the application environments block, environments can be defined through subkeys. These subkeys will be used to reference the environment from your pipeline template.

By default, application environments accept an optional `short_name` and `long_name` configuration.  These values will be set to the value of the environment name if not overridden.

An example specification defining a `dev` and `prod` environment would be:

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development"
    }
    prod{
        long_name = "Production"
    }
}
----

Then within a pipeline template, assuming there is a pipeline step called `deploy_to` that accepts an application environment as an argument, you could reference these objects via

[source,groovy]
----
build()
deploy_to dev
test()
deploy_to prod
----

== Determining Context

A created ApplicationEnvironment can determine the previous and next ApplicationEnvironment that's been defined through the `previous` and `next` properties.

The first environment's `previous` property and the last environment's `next` property will be `null`.

[NOTE]
====
These properties are automatically configured.  If you try to set the `previous` and `next` properties in the environment's definition an exception will be thrown.
====

For example, defining:

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development"
    }
    test{
        long_name = "Test"
    }
    prod{
        long_name = "Production"
    }
}
----

This will create `dev`, `test`, and `prod` objects to be leveraged in your libraries and templates.

Then, to validate their context you could create a template such as:

[source,groovy]
----
// validate dev environment's context
assert dev.previous == null
assert dev.next == test

// validate test environment's context
assert test.previous == dev
assert test.next == prod

// validate prod environment's context
assert prod.previous == test
assert prod.next == null
----

== Additional Configurations

The Application Environment primitive can also accept an arbitrary number of additional configuration fields.

This often comes in handy when libraries provide steps that accept an application environment as an input parameter. Configurations for the library across all environments would be defined in the library spec, while environment specific configurations would be defined on the environment.

Suppose there was an ec2 library that accepts a `ssh_credential_id` configuration that specifies a Jenkins credential ID containing the ssh key to access both instances and an `ip` configuration supplying the IP for the environment to scp an artifact to.

The configuration file for such a situation could be:

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
    dev{
        long_name = "Development"
        ec2{
            ip = "1.2.3.4"
        }
    }
    prod{
        ec2{
            ip = "1.2.3.5"
        }
    }
}

libraries{
    ec2{
        ssh_credential_id = "ssh_credential"
    }
}
----
