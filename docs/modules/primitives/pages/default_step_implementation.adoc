= Default Step Implementation

The JTE default step implementation allows you to generically define pipeline steps in a `steps` block in your configuration file.

This can be used for simple step implementations that can run from a container image by executing a shell command or script. Optionally, artifacts generated during the step execution can be stashed for later retrieval.

[NOTE]
====
If the default step implementation is called for a step but that step has not been defined in the `steps` block then nothing will happen.

== Example Implementation

Below is an example of configuring the default step implementation to act as a `unit_test` step to run a test suite through maven.

[source,groovy]
----
steps{
    unit_test{
        stage = "Unit Test"
        image = "maven"
        command = "mvn clean verify"
        stash{
            name = "test-results"
            includes = "./target"
            excludes = "./src"
            useDefaultExcludes = false
            allowEmpty = true
        }
    }
}
----

With this configuration in place, `unit_test()` will be callable from a pipeline template and will run `mvn clean verify` inside the `maven` container image.  The `./target` directory will be stored for later use by stashing the contents in a stash named `test-results`.

In addition to calling commands, your default step implementations can run scripts. Instead of the `*command*` field, use the `*script*` field and pass the path for the script in your application repository. Below is an example

[source,groovy]
----
steps{
    unit_test{
        stage = "Unit Test"
        image = "maven"
        script = "./tests/unit_test.sh"
        stash{
            name = "test-results"
            includes = "./target"
            excludes = "./src"
            useDefaultExcludes = false
            allowEmpty = true
        }
    }
}
----

You can name the keys within `steps` whatever you please, and they will be callable as methods.
