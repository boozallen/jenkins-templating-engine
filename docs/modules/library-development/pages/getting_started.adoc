= Getting Started

Pipeline templates allow you to define a common workflow across teams. These workflows rely on libraries to provide functionality to the steps being invoked from the template.

Configure xref:library_sources/library_sources.adoc[Library Sources] to expose libraries to pipeline jobs using the Jenkins Templating Engine.

The `libraries` block lists each library to be loaded and the library's configuration.

.pipeline configuration
[source, groovy]

libraries{
  // a list of library names goes here
}
