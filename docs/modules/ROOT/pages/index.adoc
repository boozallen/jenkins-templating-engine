The https://plugins.jenkins.io/templating-engine[Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE)] is an open source Jenkins Plugin providing a pipeline development framework that enables pipeline templating and governance.

== How Does It Work?

JTE allows pipeline developers to create common workflows (called *pipeline templates*) and share them across teams. These workflows define the business logic of your pipeline in a tool-agnostic way by calling generic functions (called *steps*).  These functions are then implemented by one or more reusable modules (called *libraries*).

Each team is able to tailor the pipeline template through their own *pipeline configuration*. The pipeline configuration declares which libraries to load prior to executing the pipeline template.

Through this approach, the same pipeline template can be reused for an arbitrary number of teams, each with their own tool integrations, by loading different libraries.
