## Overview

The Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE) is a plugin originally created by [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/) enabling pipeline templating and governance.

JTE brings the [Template Method Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method) to Jenkins pipelines.
Users can remove the Jenkinsfile from individual source code repositories in favor of a centralized, tool-agnostic [Pipeline Template](https://jenkinsci.github.io/templating-engine-plugin/2.5/concepts/pipeline-templates/).
This template provides the structure of the pipeline.

Pipeline functionality is provided by Library Steps.
For example, if the Pipeline Template references a `build()` step then the implementation of `build()` can be deferred to a user-developed library providing that step such as a Maven or Gradle library.

A hierarchical [Pipeline Configuration](https://jenkinsci.github.io/templating-engine-plugin/2.5/concepts/pipeline-configuration/) is used for each individual pipeline to determine which libraries to load (among other things).
